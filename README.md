# Generalised-Tube-Challenge-Solver

Create weighted graph of metro system. Each platform is a node and stations are represented as clusters of nodes - algorithm only needs to visit each cluster once, not every node.

![example of a metro station where 3 lines meet]('graph illustration.png')

networkx - travelling salesman algo - this would be easy if every station were one node - how to mesh this with Laporte's (2014) platform cluster model?
